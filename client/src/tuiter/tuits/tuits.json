Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with eight external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an additional layer of safety. Model 3 and Model Y built for the European and Middle Eastern markets will now utilise our camera-based Tesla Vision, which are not equipped with radar and instead rely on Tesla’s advanced suite of cameras and neural net processing to deliver Autopilot and related features"
